At first glance this looks like it could come from DPT-Lib of knx.js (https://bitbucket.org/ekarak/knx.js/src/master/src/dptlib/)
and this is certainly true for the boolean DPTs, but for most other DPTs knx.js dptlib misses
a bunch of information in a machine readable format:
 - actual ranges of the number subtypes
 - select-options and structure for composite types (DPT2, DPT3, ...)
and it also contains some not fully implemented DPTs.

Upon closer inspection it can not really be used to create the requisite Configuration-Fields required in the Compositor GUI,
some of the information from the knx.js lib is replicated here, extended and re-formatted to create the Configuration-Fields from it.
